tkeep \- time log keeper

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tkeep
.RB [ \-i | \--in ]
.RB [ \-o | \--out ]
.RB [ \-h | \-\-help ]
.RB [ \-v | \-\-version ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tkeep
is an easy way to log in and out times to a file in a human readable format.
It works by grabbing the current time, rounding it to the nearest 15 minute
increment, and writing it to the file defined by
.BR $TSLOC \.
The values
.I 1
and
.I 0
are used to represent
.I in
and
.I out
respectively.

If the
.B $TSLOC
variable is not set, then the default value of
.B $HOME/Documents/ts
will be used.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example of the output and usage of this program:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ tkeep -i
$ cat $TSLOC
1,2018-02-23T08:15:00-0500

$ #Wait ~20 minutes.

$ tkeep -o
$ cat $TSLOC
1,2018-02-23T08:15:00-0500
