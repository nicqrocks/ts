The
.I DATE
argument must be in the format YYYY/MM/DD. Keep in mind that this convert to the first minute of
that particular date. So if given:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ tsheet -a "2018/03/10"
.RE
.fi
.PP
tsheet will get times for that day as well (such as 2018-03-10T08:30:00).


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsheet
is designed to take the log generated by
.B tkeep
and format it to be a CSV of
.IR date , time-in , time-out , time-diff \.
The idea is that this can be used to take the time log and use it to determine
the time spent each day at work or on a project.

The location of the time log file is expected to be kept in the
.B $TSLOC
variable. If it is not, then it will assume that the file is at
.B $HOME/Documents/ts
instead.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example of the output and usage of this program:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ cat $TSLOC
1,2018-02-23T08:15:00-0500
0,2018-02-23T08:30:00-0500
$ tsheet
2018/03/10,08:15,08:30,0.25
